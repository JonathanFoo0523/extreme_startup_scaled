Lambda function tasks:
    # Check if game is paused
    1. send request to player and wait for response (player_api, Question object)
    2. verify response was correct (Question Object)
    3. Update database to reflect outcome and points change (Scoreboard logic to determine points change)
    4. Schedule the next question (QuestionFactory logic, RateController logic)

    QuestionFactory (round) => next question
    RateController  (player's old delay, question response type) => new delay
    Scoreboard      (player's position, question base score?, question response type) => points delta

    round - from database
    player position - from database
    old delay - from message
    question score - from message
    question response type - undertermined (depends on how they answer the question)
